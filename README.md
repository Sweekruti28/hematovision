## 📌 Project Overview

Blood cell classification plays a critical role in medical diagnostics. Manual identification is time-consuming and requires expertise. HematoVision automates this process by utilizing deep learning and transfer learning techniques.

The model classifies blood cells into four categories:

- **Eosinophil**
- **Lymphocyte**
- **Monocyte**
- **Neutrophil**
